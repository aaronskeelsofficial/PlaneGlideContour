# PlaneGlideContour
Recreate a commercial product which simulates the safe area a plane can glide to in emergency landing scenarios.
![Example](https://github.com/aaronskeelsofficial/PlaneGlideContour/raw/main/Media/Comparison.png)

Sample no heightmap consideration (52 Hz). Video shows 26 Hz but both halves were simulated in that when in reality only one needs to be simulated and then mirrored across the midline.

Sample w/ heightmap consideration (6 Hz).

Not particularly meant to be a standalone runnable program so no executable or run instructions.
